## Glossary

### A2A (Agent‑to‑Agent)

Protocol for agent discovery and collaboration, including Agent Card, streaming, push, tasks, and artifacts.

### JWT (JSON Web Token)

Compact token format for claims; commonly used for auth and signed push notifications.

### JWKS (JSON Web Key Set)

JSON document that publishes a set of public keys (e.g., for verifying JWT/JWS by `kid`).

### JWS (JSON Web Signature)

Signature format over arbitrary payloads (e.g., invoices, receipts, artifacts).

### JWK (JSON Web Key)

Representation of a single cryptographic key used with JOSE (JWT/JWS).

### OIDC (OpenID Connect)

Identity layer on top of OAuth 2.0 for federated authentication.

### OAuth2 (OAuth 2.0)

Authorization framework for delegated access.

### mTLS (Mutual TLS)

TLS where both client and server authenticate with certificates.

### PKI (Public Key Infrastructure)

System of certificates, certificate authorities, and registration authorities.

### DID (Decentralized Identifier)

Self‑sovereign identifier method (e.g., `did:web`, `did:key`).

### VC (Verifiable Credential)

Cryptographically verifiable claims issued by an issuer to a subject.

### ERC‑8004 (Trustless Agents)

EVM‑based registry interfaces for agent identity, reputation, and validation.

### EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine)

Smart contract runtime used by Ethereum and compatible chains.

### L1 (Layer 1)

Base blockchain layer (e.g., Ethereum mainnet).

### L2 (Layer 2)

Scaling layer that settles to an L1 (e.g., Base, Optimism).

### CAIP‑10 (Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal 10)

Standard for blockchain account/address identifiers.

### CAIP‑19 (Chain Agnostic Improvement Proposal 19)

Standard for on‑chain asset identifiers (e.g., ERC‑20 tokens).

### TEE (Trusted Execution Environment)

Hardware‑based isolated execution used for secure computation.

### zk (Zero‑Knowledge)

Cryptographic proofs that reveal validity without revealing underlying data.

### DSN (Decentralized Storage Network)

Distributed content‑addressed storage (e.g., Autonomys DSN via Auto Drive).

### CID (Content Identifier)

Content‑addressed hash used to locate data in DSNs.

### URI (Uniform Resource Identifier)

String identifier for resources (e.g., `https://...`).

### URL (Uniform Resource Locator)

URI that includes location/transport information.

### EIP‑191

Ethereum signing standard for human‑readable messages.

### DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization)

On‑chain governance structure operated by token holders or members.

### PII (Personally Identifiable Information)

Data that can identify an individual person.

### ABI (Application Binary Interface)

Interface specification for interacting with smart contracts.

### USDC (USD Coin)

Fiat‑pegged stablecoin commonly used for settlement.

### SPIFFE (Secure Production Identity Framework for Everyone)

Standard for workload identity in distributed systems.

### SPIRE (SPIFFE Runtime Environment)

Reference implementation of SPIFFE.

### UUIDv7 (Universally Unique Identifier version 7)

Time‑ordered UUID variant suited for high‑scale systems; preserves creation order while remaining globally unique.

### ULID (Universally Unique Lexicographically Sortable Identifier)

Time‑ordered, Base32 identifier alternative to UUIDs; lexicographically sortable.
